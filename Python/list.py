# A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items.
# It can store different data types â€” numbers, strings, or even other lists!
# list=["Ashish",1,2,"Rahul"]
# print(list)
# list.append(5) # it is used to insert the value at the end.
# print(list)

# list.extend(["Prashant","Jibin"])
# print("Extended value = ",list)

# list.insert(1,"Frooti")
# print("Inserted Value at Index 1= ",list)

# print(list[0])
# print("Last value = ",list[-1])

# print(list[1:4])#Excluding last value .
# print(list)

#Strings in Python are immutable, meaning you cannot change them after creation.
