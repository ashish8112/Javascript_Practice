Promise works in series / order of function 

suppose 
function random(resolve) 
{
    console.log("Promise executed it will give us something )
    resolve();
}

let p = new promise(random);

function promise_executed_or_youcansay_callback()
{
    console.log("Promise exeucted becuase resolve() function executed now  this function run  after getting executed .)
}

* Here random is function which will execute by constructor of promise class .
*Whenvever function parameter of random function will executed then we can say promise is executed and it will give us output or it will execute what we wants 
*And then Promise excute callback function with -> p.then(callback)
