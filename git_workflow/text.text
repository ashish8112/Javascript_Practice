git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main

1. Add a specific file
Example: You only want to add index.js
git add index.js

2. Add a specific folder
Example: You want to add the whole arrays folder (with all files inside):
git add arrays/

3. Add multiple files/folders together
git add index.js utils.js arrays/

4. VS Code way
Open Source Control panel (Ctrl + Shift + G).


You’ll see all changed files.
Click the + (stage) next to only the file(s) or folder(s) you want.
Commit → Push.


This is about keeping your local repo (on your PC with VS Code) and your GitHub repo (where Codespace made files online) in sync.

🔹 Example

You created loops.js file in your GitHub Codespace.
Your GitHub repo now has loops.js.

But your local repo (cloned earlier) doesn’t know yet.
To update your local repo:  git pull origin main

Now your loops.js will also show up in your VS Code project folder ✅

🔹 How to keep them in sync

If you code online in Codespace → pull changes in VS Code:  git pull origin main
If you code locally in VS Code → push changes:
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

This way, both sides stay updated.

🔹 VS Code GUI way

Open the Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G).
If there are changes online, VS Code will show a notification → “Pull”.
Just click it, and your local repo will get updated files.



⚠️ Important: If you edit the same file in Codespaces and locally without syncing, you might get a merge conflict. 
    In that case, Git will ask you to resolve which version to keep.
